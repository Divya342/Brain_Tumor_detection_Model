# Brain_Tumor_detection_Model

This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumors (e.g., meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors) using deep learning techniques applied to MRI scans. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and provide a tool for aiding medical professionals in treatment planning.

Features
Classification of MRI scans into:

Non-Tumor

Tumor Types:

Meningioma

Glioma

Pituitary Tumors

Uses state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis.

Preprocessing pipeline to enhance image quality and normalize data.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

OpenCV for image processing

NumPy and pandas for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Results
Accuracy: Achieved an overall classification accuracy of 95% on the validation set.

Precision/Recall: Detailed metrics provided in results/metrics_report.txt.

Visualizations of the confusion matrix and training history are available in the visualizations/ folder.
